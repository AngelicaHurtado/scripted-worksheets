* When we want to look up what a word means, we go to a dictionary. Similarly, when we want to look up what a standard JavaScript function does, we look at ______console.log_________.
* In the following piece of code, what variable(s) are in scope at Point A, Point B, and 
Point C?

```
var hooligan = true;

function hva() {
  var num = 3;
  // Point A
} 
Point A: 3

function rocks() {
  var str = "scope";
  // Point B
}
Point B: scope
// Point C
Point C: N/A
```
* What does the following code print?
"Outside the function, x is 7"
"Inside the function, x is 10"
```
var x = 7;

function someFunction() {
  var x = 10;
  console.log("Inside the function, x is " + x);
}

console.log("Outside the function, x is " + x);
someFunction();
```
* Write a function that returns the result of the following equation: 5a^2 + 4b + c. You should use the pow() function. Your function should take in three parameters (a,b,c).
